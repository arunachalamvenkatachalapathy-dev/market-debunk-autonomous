The following is a raw YouTube video transcript (may be in Tamil, Hindi, Hinglish, or a mix).
Video title: "{video_title}"

TRANSCRIPT:
{raw_transcript[:5000]}

Your task: Extract a story seed to be turned into a cinematic, entertaining, satirical short-form video about finance.

TONE & SATIRICAL DEBUNK DIRECTIVE:
- Frame the story with biting satire, irony, and sharp cynicism: expose the sheer absurdity of the financial trap or marketing gimmick.
- Make institutions, banks, or predatory brokers look ridiculous by exposing their hidden math with undeniable facts.
- Avoid boring textbook explainer language. The viewer should feel shocked and amused by how clever and brazen the trap is.
- The thesis must be provocative, witty, but completely defensible.
- The story_seed should give the script agent concrete props and relatable everyday consumer situations.

Output ONLY a valid JSON object with exactly these keys (all values in English):
{{
  "thesis": "One sentence (max 25 words): the most controversial or provocative financial claim from this content. Should make viewers say 'wait, really?!'",
  "story_seed": {{
    "inciting_event": "A specific, relatable everyday moment that sets up the story (e.g. 'Arjun checks his mutual fund app and his returns are 0% despite the Nifty being up 12%')",
    "protagonist_flaw": "The common mistake most people make, which Arjun will also make (e.g. 'He trusted his fund manager blindly and never checked the expense ratio')",
    "real_world_anchor": "The actual market fact, company name, or financial event from the transcript that this story is based on (e.g. 'HDFC AMC quietly raised its expense ratio from 1.05% to 1.35% this quarter')",
    "concept_name": "The official finance term being explained (e.g. 'Expense Ratio Drag')",
    "concept_one_liner": "One plain-English sentence explaining what this concept means (e.g. 'Even when markets go up, hidden fund fees quietly eat your profits every year')",
    "visual_evidence": "One concrete non-branded visual object that can appear on screen, such as a blurred app chart, invoice, calculator, newspaper-like clipping, or marked notebook"
